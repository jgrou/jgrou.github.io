I am a Quant Researcher at [Da Vinci](https://davincitrading.com/). Before that I was a PhD Candidate in Financial Engineering at the Applied Probability section of the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics, TU Delft under the supervision of [Antonis Papapantoleon](https://fa.ewi.tudelft.nl/~apapapantoleon/index.html).
